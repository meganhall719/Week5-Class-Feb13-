## Statistics:

some key summarizing (Descriptive) aspects of statistics... a measure of location (central tendency) for a distribution, a measure of spread or scatter around that location, and a measure of the shape of the distribution

Location

-   mean (average

-   median

-   mode

-   harmonic mean

Spread

-   mean deviation (average of abs calues of devaitions from median)

-   mean squared deviation(average of squared deviations from mean) = variance

-   standard deviation (square root of variance)

Shape

-   skewness: characterizes the asymmetry of the distribution

-   kurtosis: characterizes the peakedness/flatness of a distribution(compared to normal)

Spread

-   population variance = a paremetr

Creating a function
```{r}
x<- c(10, 100, 1000, 10000)
my_pop_variance <- function(x){
  v <- sum((x - mean(x))^2)/length(x)
  return(v)
  }


my_sample_var <- function(x){
  v <- sum((x -  mean(x))^2/(length(x)) - 1)
return(v)
  }
(a <- my_pop_variance(x))  
(b <- my_sample_var(x))
(c <- var(x))

```
